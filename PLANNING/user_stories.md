# User Stories

## MVP

1. As a user, I want to upload my arrangement so that others can download and use it.
2. As a user, I want to search for arrangements by composer or difficulty so that I can quickly find relevant ones.
3. As an admin, I want to moderate uploads and comments so that inappropriate content is removed.
4. As an admin, I want to review new uploads so I can check that the metadata is correct.
5. As a user, I want to star or tag certain arrangements so I can quickly find them later.
6. As a user, I want to easely search in categories like 'holiday' or 'movie music'.

## Stretch Goals

1. As a user, I want to transpose an arrangement before downloading it so that it fits my instrument.
2. As a user, I want to request arrangements so that the community can create them.
